title: Starting a New Chapter
---
If you were to take a look at my LinkdIn Profile prior to the date of this post everything has to do with television. Its the only real job I’ve ever had, I stumbled into it right after my 23rd birthday.. At the time I didn’t realize how good I would instinctively be at my job or how much of my life that job would become. Fast forward almost 10 years and and just a few short months ago when a friendly little tick made me take a good hard look around and I decided I wanted a break away from loud race tracks and the stress of a tour.. I had to decided the next best move for me and my overall life. Television I’d decided was out, I didn’t want to work in a studio.. If I wasn’t going to go on tour anymore then I would have to find something else. I’d always enjoyed scripting my spread sheets to the point of automation which made my job and life some much easier on the road and back when I was originally learning graphic design I was heavily into adobe flash and action script.. Seemed like the best next step for me was to find a school or a bootcamp to learn to code and take that into my next career as a Web Designer.
