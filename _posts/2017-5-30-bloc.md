title: Bloc
---
I went with bloc instead of the traditional colleges.. As a bootcamp I think its great. It has a couple bumps to get over but with the help of my mentor I was able to navigate around those bumps pretty easily.

As an example of some of the first few days of work, below is this little guy. 

{% highlight js %}
// count up to ten
for (var i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}
{% endhighlight %}

Seems so simple now but in the beginning this confused me to no end. It's a very important building bloc for your future coding skills.
