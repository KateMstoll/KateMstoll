## Explanation

BlocJams is the first and second project in the Front End portion of the bloc curriculum. It is a web based application that is built to look and act like a simple version of Spotify. 
The project begins with basic HTML and CSS setup and takes you all the way through jquery and Angular. 


## Problem

Making sure that everything worked and acted in the manner that it was suppposed to.

1. The application was visually appealing.
2. The play, previous, next buttons all worked correctly.
3. All of the buttons including navigation worked

## Solution

In the end everthing was accomplisted and a functioning web application was created.

## Results

This project wasnt always the easiest.. some was fun, alot was frustrating but in the end it was sucessful and I think that I have gained alot of knowledge from BlocJams.


## Conclusion

This Project was designed to teach me the basics of HTML and CSS and go all the way through to Javascript, Jquery, Angular, Directives, Services and Filters. I gained alot of knowledge and will be able to go back and reference that project in some of my work in the future.
