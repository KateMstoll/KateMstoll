## Explanation

Bloc Chat is a project for Bloc that uses Firebase and AngularJS to create a real-time chat application.

## Problem

Most importantly was making sure it was easy to use and worked well. 
Also making sure this web based chat application was going to appeal to the user.

## Solution

1. Using Firebase to create and keep track of the new rooms and msgs.
2. Adding a username with cookies made it easier for the user.
3. Using BootStrap and Css to create the overall look. 

## Results

This project was a difficult one for me but it did allow me to brush up on my CSS and I now know how to create a web based chat application using Firebase and Angular from scratch. 

## Conclusion

In the end the application works the way its supposed to and even though its not the prettiest chat room out on the web.. its still lavender blush.
